4. What’s a V-blank? – nesdoug

AFter each write to PPU $2007, the address (what address???) is incremented by either 1 or 32, as dictated by bit 2 of $2000
the first read from $2007 is invalid and the data will be buffered and returned on next read. does not apply to color palettes
clearing bit 7 of 0x2000 should disable NMI on vblank
setting bit 5 of 0x2000 should switch to 8x16 sprites instead of 8x8
bit 7 of $2002 should be set to indicate v blank is occurring
bit if bit 4 of $2002 is cleared, writes to VRAM are ignored
when a read from $2002 occurs, bit 7 is reset to 0, as are $2005 and $2006

if nmi interrupt is used, the program will stop what its doing when it gets a signal that v-blank is started and jump to nmi code
